TestNG (Test Next Generation) -> Developer tool     JUnit
------ 
	it is a Unit Testing tool. Unit Testing Framework

Batch Execution
Parallel Execution			1. main(String[] args)
Group Execution					@Test
Report Generation
Cross Browser Execution			2. System.out.println( );
.					     Reporter.log("  " , true);
.
.

Installation				Annotation -> Java type 
************				@interface 
1. Eclipse Market Place			
2. Install New Software 		to give info to compiler and programmer
3. Maven Dependency			it can be added on top of a variable
4. TestNG jar				method, class


TestNG class -> a class with atleast one @Test annotated method
		you can have any num of Test cases (@Test annotated method)
Test case    -> a method with @Test annotation
Test steps   -> instructions/ stmts inside a test case 

Priority:
********
when you have multiple test cases in a TestNG class
it runs based on the priority
by default the priority will be zero 
when the priority is same it runs based on alphabetical order
you can given integers (+ve 0 -ve) Priority
lowset to highest
default value is 0
Scope is in same TestNG class

InvocationCount:
***************
to run same test case for multiple times
default value is 1
if 0 or -ve value is given then that test case will not be considered for execution

ThreadPoolSize:
**************
providing threads for the execution of a test case
to run same test case multiple times in parallel

enabled:
*******
if set to false that test case will not be executed (disabled)
default value is true

timeout:
*******
used to run time critical test cases.
checks wheather the test case will be executed within the given time or not
if its not executed within the specified time then it will consider the test case as failure and stops the execution.  throws ThreadTimeoutException

dependsOnMethods:
****************
used to create dependency between test cases
if a test case is dependant on failed test case then it will not be executed
scope is in same TestNG class
TestNGException , test case depends on a nonexistent testcase

Batch Execution
***************
	Execution multiple scripts in one single click
Select multiple testNG classses, right click , TestNG , convert to TestNG
An xml file gets generated, if you run this xml file then it will execute all the test cases
in a sequential format

Parallel Execution
******************
	Execution multiple scripts in parallel in one single click
Select multiple testNG classses, right click , TestNG , convert to TestNG
An xml file gets generated, in this xml file add an attribute called as parallel="classes" at the test tag level or suite level
if you run this xml file then it will execute all the test cases in parallel 
Note : Number of testNG classes getting invoked depends on Thread-count attribute at test level

Group Execution
***************
	Execution of test cases of similar group is called as Group Execution.
In order to achieve first map the test case for a particular group using groups helper attribute. And then add groups run include tags in xml file and run that particular group.
You can map a particular test case for multiple groups,
and you can include multiple groups during the execution

DependsOnGroup
**************
	this helper attribute helps you to run a particular test case after executing all the other test cases of a particular group. 
This attribute checks all the TestNG classes in the project.

CrossBrowserTesting
*******************
	WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
1. to achieve Cross browser testing / execution
