	mvn clean	->   clears the target folder
	mvn validate	->   validating the entire framework
	mvn compile	->   compile and check for missing jars
	mvn test	->   used for executing all the test scripts /testng class
				src/test/java  -->  suffixed with Test
	mvn package	->   used for wrapping the project and creating jar
